                <p>For much of human history, books (in different forms) have been <br>the repository of knowledge. If one is seeking education, obtaining knowledge from previous generations seems like a good idea. Short items such as online articles can give you some <br>information, but not the depth of understanding that an entire book can give. Books also convey attitudes and assumptions from the time that they were written.</p>
